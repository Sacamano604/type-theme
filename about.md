Even though I have been working as a Technical Support Analyst for the past four years, my background and passion will always be web development.

My first experience with web coding was back in 1999 when I would view the source of pages to see how they were written. I would play around with code locally, see how it works and fits together. I would code in a text editor and change the extension of the file from .txt to .html. To me it was magic.

In short I love the internet, how it works, and how to make things that work with it.

I enjoyÂ coming up with little side projects and things to create. I have a github account that I'm active on and will be blogging about things I code. Feel free to contact me if you have any feedback or suggestions.
