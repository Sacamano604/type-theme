title: Learning AngularJS - First Project Complete
---


I can easily say working with AngularJS in this first project has made me a better developer. Not only have I learned about all of the elements of AngularJS but I also worked with PHP and MySQLi again. Vastly improving the code I used to put out. Not only that but it has opened my eyes to what the possibilities are, what I can do to improve from here, what I'm doing well, how to plan and approach future projects...the list goes on.

In short, my journey into the world of AngularJS has been nothing but positive. Don't get me wrong, there were ups and downs. Head scratching and banging my head against the desk but it was worth it every step of the way. If I could describe AngularJS to people I would refer them to an <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2439-my-experience-with-angularjs-the-super-heroic-javascript-mvw-framework.htm" target="_blank">article by Ben Nadel</a> which is pretty funny.

Very special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/THEseanwalsh" target="_blank">Sean Walsh</a> for not only introducing me to the framework but being there with me every step of the way and helping me troubleshoot. If I could recommend anything to new or struggling developers (cough) is try and watch an experienced developer debug and work on projects. The way they troubleshoot and work through problems is an invaluable lesson and I really benefited from our 'sessions'.

In terms of my football app, I've tidied up the CSS and made the app look a little more presentable so here's a link for you if you'd like to see:

I will be working more with AngularJS so stay tuned to see  my next project.
