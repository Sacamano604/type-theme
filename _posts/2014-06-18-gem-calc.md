title: Javascript - Gem Calculator for Diablo 3 Reaper of Souls
---

I recently started to brush up on my JavaScript skills and one of the ideas I had for a project came from a friend, <a title="Sean Walsh Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/THEseanwalsh" target="_blank">Sean Walsh</a>. We were both playing the new Diablo 3 expansion: Reaper of Souls. One of the parts of this game requires you to craft certain gems in order to reroll stats on amulets and ring (don’t get me started). He suggested that something I do if create a calculator, where we would type in what kind of gem we needed and how many, then the application would spit out how much of each gem below that tier you would need.

So set out to build this thing. I started with one type of gem and set out to create. On my first iteration I had something like this:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Sacamano604/174326d288757bc84857.js"></script>

Now if you look at this we pose a problem in that I would not only need to create a function for each type of gem but I would also need to create one massive if/else statement which seemed inefficient. You see, each tier of gem in Diablo requires 3 of the previous gem. So if you need 3 Royals, you would need 9 Flawless Imperial, 27 Imperial, and 81 Marquise.

I felt like I was on the right track but I would need to refine this. An idea that I had from my friend is what if you pass the quantity of gems from the previous tier up a level, and multiply. After tinkering, and some help from him, I had something like this:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Sacamano604/fc4ba769cdafa31c60d6.js"></script>

I created the &lt;p&gt; tag hidden classes on the html page and my idea was to unhide each as needed. From there all I needed to do was have a switch to call these functions:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Sacamano604/efe7aae26aed178b8bfb.js"></script>

I had success. I was able to pass the quantity up the chain and get the results I needed.
