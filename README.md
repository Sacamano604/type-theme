website-redesign
====================

Redesigning my website to work with the flat-file CMS [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Will also install and customize the [type-theme](https://github.com/rohanchandra/type-theme) Jekyll theme. 

Gives me a good opportunity to work a little with ruby gems and git at the command line.
